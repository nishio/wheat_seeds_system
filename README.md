# Wheat Seeds System

Wheat Seeds System is a system for placing custom models in the Minecraft world.
It was developed to build a virtual office for Cybozu/Kintone branches around the world for the Cybozu Hackathon in 2021. ([Slide for Cybozu Hackathon 2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MQUx9hC2MEXWYCoXcmlLVHFBsV6k9_A8fzVUNfggHr8/edit?usp=sharing))

With this system, custom models do not harm existing models.
Also, this system does not require any client-side MOD. The main technologies are the resource pack mechanism and the custom model override mechanism supported by the vanilla client.
